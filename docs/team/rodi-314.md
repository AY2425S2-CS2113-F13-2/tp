## Project: BoboType

### Overview

Bobotype is a minimalist, interactive CLI tool that enhances typing speed and accuracy through personalized exercises,
real-time feedback, and progress tracking, helping users build muscle memory and confidence efficiently.
Given below are my contributions to the project.

### Summary of Contributions

- **New Feature**: Added the ability to undo/redo previous commands.
  - What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
  - Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
  - Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
  - Credits: {mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}
- **New Feature**: Added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
