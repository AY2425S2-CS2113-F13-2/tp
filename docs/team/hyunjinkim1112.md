## Project: BoboType

### Overview

Bobotype is a minimalist, interactive CLI tool that enhances typing speed and accuracy through personalized
exercises, real-time feedback, and progress tracking, helping users build muscle memory and confidence
efficiently.

### Summary of Contributions

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- **Text Selector:**  Added the text selector to randomly select the text to display from the resources based on the difficulty level and length. 
    - What it does: based on the difficulty level and the length, it randomly selects the text and read the text file from the resources.
    - Justification: This implementation serves as the basis of 2 different modes of the program (normal mode, time limit mode). 
    - Highlights: This enhancement allowed the program to read and add text sources easily in .txt file format. 


- **Time Limit Mode:** Added the new mode to set a time limit for the user to type the given sentence
    - What it does: allows the user to practice typing at the timed environment. 
    - Justification: This feature allows the user to practice their typing in more game-like, timed manner. 
    - Highlights: This enhancement required the use of multithreaded programming as it needs to process the user input while interrupting it when the time is up.
