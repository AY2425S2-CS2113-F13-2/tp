On a sunny day, the park is a great place to relax. Many people walk their dogs, children play on swings, and families have picnics. The trees provide shade, and the grass is soft underfoot. Some people like to sit on benches, reading books or chatting with friends. The sound of birds chirping adds to the peaceful atmosphere. There are also small ponds where ducks swim, and sometimes, you can see children feeding them. Everyone enjoys the fresh air and the opportunity to spend time outside.
