There are four seasons in a year: spring, summer, fall, and winter. In spring, flowers bloom, and the weather starts to warm up. Summer is hot, and people often go to the beach or have barbecues. In fall, the leaves change color, and the weather becomes cooler. Winter is cold, and sometimes it snows. Each season has its own special qualities, and itâ€™s fun to enjoy the changes in nature throughout the year.
