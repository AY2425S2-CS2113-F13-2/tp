Last summer, I went on a road trip with my friends. We drove to the mountains, excited to explore the outdoors. The journey was long, but the scenery was beautiful. We passed by forests, rivers, and small towns. When we reached our destination, we went hiking and spent time enjoying the fresh air. At night, we sat around a campfire, telling stories and roasting marshmallows. The stars in the sky were brighter than I had ever seen before. It was a peaceful and unforgettable experience. We didnâ€™t have to worry about the usual hustle and bustle of daily life, and it felt great to reconnect with nature.
