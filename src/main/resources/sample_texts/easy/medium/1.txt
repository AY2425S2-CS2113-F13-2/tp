On a quiet street, an ice cream truck stops, playing cheerful music. Children rush out with coins in hand. The vendor smiles as he serves their favorite flavors. Vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry cones make everyone happy. Parents stand nearby, laughing, as their kids enjoy the cold treats under the warm sun.
