The beach is lively with families enjoying the sunny day. Kids build sandcastles while waves crash gently on the shore. Ice cream vendors ring their bells, attracting eager customers. A couple walks hand-in-hand, collecting seashells. The salty breeze refreshes everyone, and the sound of the ocean soothes their minds.
